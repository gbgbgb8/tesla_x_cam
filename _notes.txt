To complete the project, you'll need to implement the following:

Improve the video layout manager to allow users to select which video is in full view.
Implement the time range selector functionality to jump to specific dates and times.
Develop the video export functionality using ffmpeg.wasm to combine multiple video sets into a single video.
Add audio file support and microphone recording for narration.
Implement error handling and user feedback.


Project Name: Tesla X Cam Viewer
Description:
The Tesla X Cam Viewer is a web-based application designed to provide Tesla owners with an intuitive and efficient way to view and export footage from their vehicle's built-in dashcam system. This project aims to simplify the process of reviewing multi-angle dashcam footage and create shareable videos for social media platforms like X (formerly Twitter).
Current Features:

Video Loading: Users can select and load multiple MP4 files from their Tesla's USB drive directly in the browser.
Multi-angle Display: The application supports simultaneous viewing of up to four camera angles (Front, Back, Left, Right).
Dynamic Layout: Users can customize the layout by choosing which camera angle to display in the main view and in each corner.
Video Synchronization: All visible video streams are synchronized for seamless playback.
Time Range Selection: Users can navigate through the footage using a time range selector.
Export Functionality: The application allows exporting combined video in various formats:

Landscape (1280x720)
Portrait (720x1280)
Square (720x720)
Original (1280x960)


Local Processing: All video processing is done client-side in the browser, ensuring user privacy and reducing server load.

Current State:
The application is functional but in a prototype stage. It's hosted on Vercel and uses purely client-side processing. The core functionality of video playback and layout management is implemented, and the export feature uses the browser's MediaRecorder API to combine visible video streams.
Key Components:

index.html: Provides the structure of the web application.
style.css: Defines the layout and appearance of the application.
script.js: Handles video loading, synchronization, and layout management.
export.js: Manages the video export process using the MediaRecorder API.

Lessons Learned:

Cross-Origin Limitations: Initially, we attempted to use ffmpeg.wasm for video processing, but encountered issues with cross-origin restrictions and SharedArrayBuffer availability.
Client-Side Processing: We learned that modern browsers are capable of handling complex video operations, allowing us to shift from server-side processing to a purely client-side approach.
MediaRecorder API: We discovered that the MediaRecorder API provides a powerful and browser-compatible way to capture and combine video streams without external libraries.
Vercel Deployment: We gained experience in deploying and configuring a web application on Vercel, including understanding the limitations and requirements of serverless platforms.

Roadmap for the Future:

Performance Optimization: Improve the efficiency of video processing, especially for longer recordings or lower-end devices.
Enhanced Time Navigation: Implement a timeline scrubber for more precise navigation through the footage.
Audio Support: Add the ability to include audio from one of the video streams or add a separate audio track during export.
Customizable Overlays: Allow users to add text, timestamps, or other overlays to the exported video.
Clip Selection: Implement a feature to select specific time ranges for export rather than the entire video duration.
Format Options: Expand export options to include different codecs and quality settings.
Persistent Settings: Add the ability to save user preferences for layout and export settings.
Mobile Optimization: Improve the user interface and performance for mobile devices.
Offline Support: Implement PWA features to allow the app to function offline.
Batch Processing: Add the ability to process multiple sets of dashcam footage in a single session.
Integration with Tesla API: Explore the possibility of directly accessing dashcam footage from the vehicle (subject to Tesla's API capabilities).
Community Features: Implement sharing and community features for Tesla owners to share interesting or noteworthy footage.

Challenges to Address:

Browser Compatibility: Ensure consistent functionality across different browsers and versions.
Large File Handling: Optimize the application to handle very large video files or long recording sessions efficiently.
Export Speed: Improve the speed of the export process, especially for longer videos or complex layouts.
User Education: Provide clear instructions and possibly tutorials for users who may not be familiar with video editing concepts.

This project demonstrates the potential of web technologies for complex video processing tasks and provides a valuable tool for Tesla owners. As we continue to develop and refine the Tesla X Cam Viewer, we aim to create a robust, user-friendly application that enhances the utility of Tesla's built-in dashcam system.
